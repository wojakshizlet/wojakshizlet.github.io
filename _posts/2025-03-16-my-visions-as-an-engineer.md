Being an engineer is more than just a title. It's also about continuing to be the best version of yourself for not just you, but also for the general public. You have an obligation to serve the people in your own community, and perhaps even the entire globe. As an aspiring engineer, the reasons outlined above are exactly why I personally and strongly believe that I should strive to be open minded, responsible, and always willing to learn. 

If I want to make the world a better place, it starts within the places I go, as well as giving back to the community, friends, family, and all of the other people that helped me throughout my journey. It also stems from the care and love that I hold for them, as well as the world as a whole. I envision a unified future amongst the community around me, where everyone in it can navigate it freely. Iâ€™m always driven by curiosity as to how things work in the world. This in turn challenges me to continue to learn new things, foster my problem solving and critical thinking skills, and to leave behind a legacy for many years to come.

Getting others inspired to do the same or something that may be similar is very crucial for this ideal future. I do believe that if we all attempt to foster that innate curiosity, passion, open-mindedness, and the willingness to learn, we can put our heads together and make the world a better place for themselves and everybody else around them. This would lead to more room for expressing oneself as an individual, and fostering creativity. Much like a domino effect, this would also encourage others around them to do the same in regards to expressing themselves.
