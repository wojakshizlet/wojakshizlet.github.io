## What have I been up to lately?
You're probably wondering what I've been doing as of late while I'm on my co-op term. </br>
To put it honestly, I've been quite busy with work and other things on the side! I've been doing my best to develop not just my technical skills, but also my soft skills.
What are these side things, you might ask? 
Well, allow me to show you a glimpse of my world!

## Velocity Community Day - Winter 2025: Thursday, April 3rd 2025

Velocity is a student development program that is a joint effort between Scotiabank (where I'm currently co-op'ing at), and Tangerine. Usually there's lots of events being hosted all term long! Recently, we had our Community Day; which focuses on celebrating the interns. 
</br>
</br>The theme for this term's Community Day was Wellness and Mental Health. As seen in the picture, we all had a lovely time at Paint Cabin painting up a storm, and letting those creative juices run absolutely wild.

I had the honour of joining this summit as one of the three MCs! On the side, I am part of SOAR With Mentor; which is a mentorship program for young women in the technology sector. As part of it, I was given this wonderful opportunity! I couldn't be more grateful! 
</br>
</br>The entire day was a huge blast! We had a lot of food, a lot of breakout rooms, and lots of networking opportunities! Companies and partners of Dell came from all over to be part of this event. It was a sight to behold!

Outside of work, I've been really into this one game called "Pokemon White 2" lately. I'm having a blast so far!
</br>
</br> As for my other smaller projects, I've also been in the process of building my very own desktop computer. I have all the parts I need, I just need to assemble it! For those curious tech nerds out there, here are the specs over at PCPartPicker. Feel free to take a look!

</br>
</br> I have also been trying to put together my very own NAS Server using a Raspberry Pi 5! It's an effort to streamline the file sharing process between my phone, tablet, laptop, and soon my desktop computer that I am building. It's been something I've needed for quite some time for both school and personal projects. I can't wait for when it's finished!
</br> 
</br> My New 3DS XL is also in dire need of refurbishment, since my directional-pad is broken, and the exterior is all worn down. Much like my PC, I only just obtained the parts. I also got a fancy screwdriver kit in case of future repairs/refurbishments that are also needed.
I will try to start it whenever possible! I'm so excited!
