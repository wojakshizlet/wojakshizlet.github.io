## About Me
My name is Shiza, and I am currently a 3rd year Computer Science student. In my spare time, I absolutely love to crochet and play video games. Oh, and I love lounging around in bed too if that counts as a hobby! What really helped me become the person I am today is consistently engaging in arts and crafts as I grew up, as well as loads of video games.

For the first 14 years of my life, I was born and raised in the northeast end of Scarborough. After those 14 years were up, I moved to the further east end of the city where I still reside even today. Having a community of like-minded people definitely affected me a lot growing up.

I continued to seek out like-minded people even as I took the grand leap out of my childhood days and into my undergraduate days as an adult. Hence why I had chosen Lassonde. I was in love with the idea of meeting new people at a school and faculty that values me for who I am. Growing up around various kinds of technology compelled me to choose Computer Science over all else. I was hungry to learn how technology even works, and even how the WiFi gets delivered to my video game consoles and my computer. My curiosity that will never be satiated, and passion for technology that never runs dry is what keeps me going and will continue to help me succeed at this school and faculty.

If there’s anyone I ever looked up to and still do, it would be my Computer Science teacher who taught me in both Grade 11 and 12. I forever am indebted to him and would not be where I am today. He taught me how to code, and even helped me land an internship. His motto was always, “never give up”. Which I’d deeply admired in him even today. 

The artifact I have chosen is the humble, yet mighty transistor. It acts as a switch in our electronics. There are hundreds of billions of them in our modern technology and are responsible for powering them. I don’t think I’d ever become who I am today without the technology I grew up with. And since transistors power them all, it’s an integral part of who I am and what I continue to do everyday.

Below is my "Why Me" video that I have created for this course. Feel free to give it a watch!
