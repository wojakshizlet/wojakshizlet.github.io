Hi everyone! My name is Shiza. I am currently a 3rd-year in Computer Science at York University, and I am doing my 8-month co-op term at Scotiabank as a Global Network Analyst. Presently, I am actively exploring various fields with ties to hardware. So far, I have decided to focus my degree in both computer networking and embedded systems.

In my spare time, I love to crochet and play video games! The game that I am currently playing is "Pokemon White 2" on my Nintendo 3DS console. Feel free to explore my social media below!
