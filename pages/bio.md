Hello world!

My name is Shiza. I am a rising 3rd-year in Computer Science at York University! I am currently actively exploring diverse interests within my major with keen focuses in computer networking and embedded systems.

I hope to further bolster my journey of practical learning! In particular, I have prior experience as an IT Intern at TDSB, a Global Network Analyst Intern at Scotiabank, as well as several diverse side projects.

Please feel free to connect and reach out to explore any opportunities you feel that would make me a great fit!
